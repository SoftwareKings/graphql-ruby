_Sources_ are what {{ "GraphQL::Dataloader" | api_doc }} uses to fetch data from external services.

## Source Concepts

Sources are classes that inherit from `GraphQL::Dataloader::Source`. A Source _must_ implement `def fetch(keys)` to return a list of objects, one for each of the given keys. A source _may_ implement `def initialize(dataloader, ...)` to accept other batching parameters.

Sources will receive two kinds of inputs from `GraphQL::Dataloader`:

- _keys_, which correspond to objects requested by the application.

  Keys are passed to `def fetch(keys)`, which must return an object (or `nil`) for each of `keys`, in the same order as `keys`.

  Under the hood, each Source instance maintains a `key => object` cache.

- _batch parameters_, which are the basis of batched groups. For example, if you're loading records from different database tables, the the table name would be a batch parameter.

  Batch parameters are given to `dataloader.with(source_class, *batch_parameters)`, and the default is _no batch parameters_. When you define a source, you should add the batch parameters to `def initialize(dataloader, ...)` and store them in instance variables.

  (`dataloader.with(source_class, *batch_parameters)` returns an instance of `source_class` with the given batch parameters -- but it might be an instance which was cached by `dataloader`.)

## Example: Loading Strings from Redis by Key

The simplest source might fetch values based on their keys. For example:

```ruby
# app/graphql/sources/redis_string.rb
class Sources::RedisString < GraphQL::Dataloader::Source
  REDIS = Redis.new
  def fetch(keys)
    # Redis's `mget` will return a value for each key with a `nil` for any not-found key.
    REDIS.mget(*keys)
  end
end
```

This loader could be used in GraphQL like this:

```ruby
some_string = dataloader.with(Sources::RedisString).load("some_key")
```

Calls to `.load(key)` will be batched, and when `GraphQL::Dataloader` can't go any further, it will dispatch a call to `def fetch(keys)` above.

## Example: Loading ActiveRecord Objects by ID

To fetch ActiveRecord objects by ID, the source should also accept the _model class_ as a batching parameter. For example:

```ruby
# app/graphql/sources/active_record_object.rb
class Sources::ActiveRecordObject < GraphQL::Dataloader::Source
  def initialize(model_class)
    @model_class = model_class
  end

  def fetch(ids)
    records = @model_class.where(id: ids)
    # return a list with `nil` for any ID that wasn't found
    ids.map { |id| records.find { |r| r.id == id.to_i } }
  end
end
```

This source could be used for any `model_class`, for example:

```ruby
author = dataloader.with(Sources::ActiveRecordObject, ::User).load(1)
post = dataloader.with(Sources::ActiveRecordObject, ::Post).load(1)
```

## Example: Batched Calculations

Besides fetching objects, Sources can return values from batched calculations. For example, a system could batch up checks for who a user follows:

```ruby
# for a given user, batch checks to see whether this user follows another user.
# (The default `user.followings.where(followed_user_id: followed).exists?` would cause N+1 queries.)
class Sources::UserFollowingExists < GraphQL::Dataloader::Source
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def fetch(handles)
    # Prepare a `SELECT id FROM users WHERE handle IN(...)` statement
    user_ids = ::User.where(handle: handles).select(:id)
    # And use it to filter this user's followings:
    followings = @user.followings.where(followed_user_id: user_ids)
    # Now, for followings that _actually_ hit a user, get the handles for those users:
    followed_users = ::User.where(id: followings.select(:followed_user_id))
    # Finally, return a result set, with one entry (true or false) for each of the given `handles`
    handles.map { |h| !!followed_users.find { |u| u.handle == h }}
  end
end
```

It could be used like this:

```ruby
is_following = dataloader.with(Sources::UserFollowingExists, context[:viewer]).load(handle)
```

After all requests were batched, `#fetch` will return a Boolean result to `is_following`.

## Example: Loading in a background thread

Inside `Source#fetch(keys)`, you can call `dataloader.yield` to return control to the Dataloader. This way, it will proceed loading other Sources (if there are any), then return the source that yielded.

A simple example, spinning up a new Thread:

```ruby
def fetch(keys)
  # spin up some work in a background thread
  thread = Thread.new {
    fetch_external_data(keys)
  }
  # return control to the dataloader
  dataloader.yield
  # at this point,
  # the dataloader has tried everything else and come back to this source,
  # so block if necessary:
  thread.value
end
```

For a more robust asynchronous task primitive, check out [`Concurrent::Future`](http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Concurrent/Future.html).

Ruby 3.0 added built-in support for yielding Fibers that make I/O calls -- hopefully a future GraphQL-Ruby version will work with that!
