Class: GraphQL::Schema < Object
A GraphQL schema which may be queried with GraphQL::Query. 
The Schema contains: 
- types for exposing your application
- query analyzers for assessing incoming queries (including max
depth & max complexity restrictions)
- execution strategies for running incoming queries
- middleware for interacting with execution
Schemas start with root types, Schema#query, Schema#mutation and
Schema#subscription. The schema will traverse the tree of fields &
types, using those as starting points. Any undiscoverable types may
be provided with the `types` configuration. 
Schemas can restrict large incoming queries with `max_depth` and
`max_complexity` configurations. (These configurations can be
overridden by specific calls to Schema#execute) 
Schemas can specify how queries should be executed against them.
`query_execution_strategy`, `mutation_execution_strategy` and
`subscription_execution_strategy` each apply to corresponding root
types. 
A schema accepts a `Relay::GlobalNodeIdentification` instance for
use with Relay IDs. 
Examples:
# defining a schema
MySchema = GraphQL::Schema.define do
query QueryType
middleware PermissionMiddleware
rescue_from(ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound) { "Not found" }
# If types are only connected by way of interfaces, they must be added here
orphan_types ImageType, AudioType
end
