Class: GraphQL::Schema::TimeoutMiddleware::TimeoutError < GraphQL::E...
This error is raised when a query exceeds `max_seconds`. Since it's
a child of GraphQL::ExecutionError, its message will be added to the
response's `errors` key. 
To raise an error that will stop query resolution, use a custom
block to take this error and raise a new one which _doesn't_ descend
from GraphQL::ExecutionError, such as `RuntimeError`.
